            There are evidently different parts to a URL (uniform resource locator). When browsing the Internet, no two URLs are the same
              because they're like addresses to different sites on the web. Some of the parts that make up the
              URL include the protocol, domain name, subdomain, top-level domain, and path. In the image on the right,
              we can see some of these components laid out. There can be other components to a URL as well including the port,
              parameters, query, and fragment, but these are the ones that the majority of websites contain in their URLs.

    <b>The domain name is what we consider to be "the website name."</b> Examples include "google.com", "amazon.com", and
    "njit.edu". This is the part of the URL that most people are familiar with. Within the domain name, however, is the
    top-level domain. The top-level domain is the bit at the end of the domain name. For google.com, the top-level domain
    is ".com". Top-level domains usually refer to a category that website has been classified in. For example,
    .com was meant for websites for commercial use, .gov is used for government websites, and .edu is used for websites
    by universities. Additionally, the subdomain (not all URLs will have one) refers to what is typically a subsection of
    the website of the domain name. <b>Overall, domain names are useful for identifying different web pages and keeping
track of each unique URL address.</b>

    <b>ICANN stands for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.</b> ICANN is an organization that was founded in 1998
    to manage the Internet Protocol (IP) and Domain Name System (DNS). Their main headquarters is in Los Angeles.
    The organization was founded in the United States,
    but now handles the Internet on a global scale. Part of their responsibilities include
    managing domain names and top-level domains. <b>ICANN ensures that all addresses are unique and that Internet users are able
    to use these valid addresses. Other responsibilities they hold include managing the Internet Protocol spaces
    for IPv4 and IPv6, managing the regional Internet registries, and managing generic top-level domains (something they introduced
    to companies in the early 2010s). All of this and more is vital to being able to use the Internet.</b>
    Currently, the CEO and President of ICANN is Goran Marby and the Chair of the Board is
    Maarten Botterman. Jon Postel is the man who founded ICANN, but passed soon after ICANN was founded.
