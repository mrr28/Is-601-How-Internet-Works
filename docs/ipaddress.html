<h3 style="margin: 25px">IP Addresses</h3>
<p style="margin: 50px">
    In the early days of the Internet, there wasn't a standard way to communicate between devices. As we may know,
    the Internet is a network of networks and links billions of devices all over the world. Because of how huge the Internet is,
    there is something called an Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet Protocol essentially sets the rules for how the Internet
    is used among devices. Part of the Internet Protocol is that each device connected to the Internet have an IP address.
    It is similar to how each house or building has a mailing address, only each device has an address on the Internet.
    Each device has their own unique IP address. IP addresses contain information about a device's country, region, subnetwork, and specific device.
    They also allow for devices to communicate back and forth, between each other to websites and to web servers.
</p>

<p style="margin: 50px">
    Originally, IP addresses were 32 bits long. These sets of IP addresses began being used in the 1970s and was called
    IPv4. IPv4 was able to account for 4 billion devices. This seems like a lot, but as it turns out as society progresses
    and technology becomes more and more prevalent, there was a need to expand the system further. Hence, IPv6 is beginning to be
    used and being transitioned into the Internet today. IPv6 will account for 340 undecillion unique IP addresses in total,
    which will be more than enough for each grain of sand on Earth to own its own IP address.
