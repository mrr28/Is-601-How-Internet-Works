<h3 style="margin: 50px">IP Addresses</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px">
    In the early days of the Internet, there wasn't a standard way to communicate between devices. As we may know,
    the Internet is a network of networks and links billions of devices all over the world. Because of how huge the Internet is,
    there is something called an Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet Protocol essentially sets the rules for how the Internet
    is used among devices. <b>Part of the Internet Protocol is that each device connected to the Internet have its own unique IP address
    so that it can be individually identified on the web.</b>
    It is similar to how each house or building has a mailing address, only each device has an address on the Internet.
    Each device has their own unique IP address. IP addresses contain information about a device's country, region, subnetwork, and specific device.
    They also allow for devices to communicate back and forth, between each other to websites and to web servers.

            <p style="margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px;margin-top: 25px">
    Originally, IP addresses were 32 bits long. These sets of IP addresses began being used in the 1970s and was called
    IPv4. IPv4 was able to account for 4 billion devices. This seems like a lot, but as it turns out as society progresses
    and technology becomes more and more prevalent, there was a need to expand the system further. Hence, IPv6 is beginning to be
    used and being transitioned into the Internet today. IPv6 will account for 340 undecillion unique IP addresses in total,
    which will be more than enough for each grain of sand on Earth to own its own IP address.

<h3 style="margin: 25px">Packet Switching and Routing</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px">
    In order for data and information to get from devices and servers through the Internet, they have to travel in some
    way. Enter the routing and packet switching network. Information and data is broken down into what are called packets.
    Packets hold bits of information that is going to be transmitted through the Internet. In a network, individual packets
    are able to take any route necessary to get to its given digital destination so long as they end up in the same place.
    <b>This is known as the packet switching network.</b>
    Depending on Internet traffic, there are infinite number of routes for packets to take. The image below shows a quick example
    of what the packet switching network looks like with a couple of packets being sent from one computer to another. With just
    those two packets, they are taking different routes in the network but still end up in the same place. <b>The use
    of the packet switching network is important to the way data is transmitted through the Internet. </b> Large bits of information
    couldn't be held all at the same time through the same route: separating and reassembling these packets after sending each
    one through its route is efficient and allows for data to be sent back and forth as cheaply and quickly as possible.
</p>
<div class="text-center">
<img src="https://networkencyclopedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/packet-switching.png" style="max-height: 400px">
</div>
<p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px">
    Along the way are routers. <b>Routers act sort of like Internet traffic managers that keep the packets moving smoothly
    through the network.</b> Each router keeps track of different paths the packets take, monitoring where they end up going.
    The goal is to have packets take the cheapest and most available path, which may also not be the most direct path. Because
    of how many packets there can be at a time, and especially since packets can only hold so many bits of data, it is beneficial
    to have more routers. More routers means more reliability in the packet switching network.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 25px; margin-left: 50px;margin-right: 50px">
    At the very end of the road when packets arrive at the destination is the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The TCP
    sending and receiving of information and data as packets. It makes sure that all packets have arrived. If not every packet
    has arrived at the end, it won't be approved by TCP and packets will be resent. TCP is also scalable and can work on a range
    of Internet devices. Overall, the Internet is able to work because of all of these things working together.
