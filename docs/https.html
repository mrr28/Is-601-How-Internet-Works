            When looking at web addresses or URLs (uniform resource locators) on a web browser, you may notice that each of
            these addresses begins with either "http" or "https". <b>HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
            HTTP is the language that is used to communicate
                between web browsers and servers and is made up of GET requests.</b> In the image to the right, you can see there
            is a difference between the computer on the left and the computer on the right. The URL of the computer on the left
            contains http://, which is the standard beginning of a URL. However, the computer on the right shows a green lock
            before the https://. The computer on the right indicates that the website that is up is secured. If a website
            you are on is considered safe and secure, you should be able to see the same thing in the address bar of your
            web browser. Websites also have digital certificates that are published by certificate authorities to ensure the website
            is what it actually is.

    <b>The way that sites can be secure and safe is thanks to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).</b>
    These tools help prevent snooping and tampering of URLs. These are what give the site the lock and 'https' in the
    web address and hence protect users on the Internet. The way SSL and TLS work is through encryption.
</p>

<p style="margin-right:50px;margin-left: 50px">
    Encryption makes it possible for data and information being transmitted on the Internet to stay private. Simply put,
    <b>encryption takes a message being sent and scrambles it. Decryption is the opposite: taking a scrambled message and unscrambling
        it in order to understand what it says.</b> Encryption is a method that has been used for centuries. One of the earliest
    examples is the use of Caesar's Cipher: an algorithm with a numbered key. If for example, the message is "hey" with a key of four,
    that means the encrypted message will be "lic". The key of four means that each letter in that message is the next fourth
    letter in the alphabet after that letter. (Once the end of the alphabet is reached, it starts over.)

        <div class="col">
            <p style="margin-right:50px;margin-left: 50px">
            Evidently, modern encryption methods have to be more complex and difficult than Caesar's Cipher. What we use on the Internet are
            256 bit keys that provide a great number of possibilities of ways to decrypt a message. This makes it harder for hackers
            to decrypt any intercepted messages because it's too hard, too hard meaning there are too many possibilities that is
            reasonable for a computer to go through in a certain period of time. The longer the keys are, the more the number of guesses
            to crack the cipher.

    Furthermore, when it comes to the Internet and between devices that don't communicate keys with each
    other ahead of time, they use asymmetric encryption as opposed to symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is when the
    sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. But asymmetric encryption is when different keys
    are used for encryption and decryption. This is what devices on the Internet use. Asymmetric encryption also uses
    public keys and private keys. Public keys are what everyone has to use encrypt messages. Private keys are used
    by computers to decrypt messages sent to them.
