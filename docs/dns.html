     <b>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for content on the Internet.</b>
        When using the Internet, the IP addresses of devices and websites are kept track by
        Domain Name System. If someone is accessing Google.com, for example, the device they are using will reach out to the
        Internet server, requesting to access the site and be given the associated IP address to access it. The DNS takes the
        domain name of Google and its IP address, translates it to the IP address, and sends it to the device requesting it.
        With that IP address, the device is then able to display Google's home page. This way, no one has
        to memorize any IP addresses and can just use the URLs to access information.

            However, no one DNS server can hold all the information to all of the IP addresses. There are actually multiple
            DNS servers that help with containing information to all the IP addresses there are in the world. <b>No matter how many IP addresses
                or devices there are, DNS is designed to scale and will be able to handle any number of them.</b> Additionally,
            there are four DNS servers that come into play. These four servers are the DNS recursor, root nameserver,
            TLD (top level domain) nameserver, and authoritative nameserver. More on the different DNS servers can
            be read <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" style="color: blue">here</a>.

                Let's also look at a visual to exhibit how this works. For simplicity sake, I will just be explaining the DNS
                server as if it was a single entity. There are four components here and the goal is for the user to be able to
                go on Amazon.com. A user requests to go on Amazon.com and in order to get there, the computer has to make a GET
                request to the web server. The web server will then go to the DNS Server to get the IP address necessary for
                accessing Amazon.com. The DNS server will find the IP address associated with that website in the request, then
                send it back to the web server, which will be sent back to the user. Now the user will be able to view Amazon.com.
                Of course, this all happens in less than a second and is done every time a user accesses a different website.

        Because the Internet is public and open and very connected, there lies some risk to using it as well.
        One of these risks specifically with DNS is DNS spoofing. DNS spoofing is when a hacker changes a DNS server
        to give and match it with fake IP addresses and fake websites to mislead people. This can be dangerous to people who
        are expecting to browse one website but are actually led to a fake one where hackers can do a number of things
        on there including steal information or give other devices malicious software or viruses.
